## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases and methods to access the databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a basic functionality that makes BambangShop work: ability to create, read, and delete `Product`s.
This repository already contains a functioning `Product` model, repository, service, and controllers that you can try right away.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement another feature: `Notification`.
This feature will notify creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, to external subscribers that are interested of a certain product type.
The subscribers are another Rocket instances, so the notification will be sent using HTTP POST request to each subscriber's `receive notification` address.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Publisher" folder.
This Postman collection also contains endpoints that you need to implement later on (the `Notification` feature).

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable              | type   | description                                                |
    |-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where this publisher instance can be accessed. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Publisher) Reflections

#### Reflection Publisher-1
1. **Interface (trait) >< struct**  
In this case, the Observer pattern is simplified, so a struct is enough to represent the data. A trait becomes useful only when polymorphism or extensibility is required.
2. **Vec >< DashMap**  
Vec is not sufficient because it does not enforce uniqueness and requires O(n) lookup. DashMap is necessary since we need fast insertion, deletion, and lookup by unique keys.
3. **DashMap >< Singleton**  
In Rust, thread safety is enforced at the data structure level. Therefore, using DashMap is necessary, while Singleton only addresses instance control, not concurrency.

#### Reflection Publisher-2
1. **Why separate “Service” and “Repository” from Model?**  
Separating Service and Repository follows SRP, where Model focuses on data structure, Repository handles data access, and Service manages business logic. It also enables better testability, since Service and Repository can be tested independently.
2. **What happens if we only use the Model?**  
If only Model is used, each Model (Program, Subscriber, Notification) must handle both logic and data access, causing high coupling and bloated code. The codebase becomes difficult to extend, because adding new features requires modifying multiple models with mixed responsibilities.
3. **How Postman helps in testing?**  
Postman helps by allowing us to send HTTP requests and validate API responses quickly without writing frontend code. Also, I find Collections, Environment variables, and History useful to organize and repeat tests during development.

#### Reflection Publisher-3
1. **Which variation of Observer Pattern is used?**  
This tutorial uses the Push model, where the publisher directly sends notification data to subscribers via HTTP requests. The subscriber does not need to request additional data from the publisher.
2. **Advantages and disadvantages of using the Pull model** 
Using the Pull model would reduce data redundancy because subscribers can request only the data they need. However, it introduces additional latency and complexity since subscribers must make extra requests after receiving a notification trigger. 
3. **Impact of not using multi-threading in notification**  
If multi-threading is not used, the system becomes less scalable because each notification must complete before the next one starts.
